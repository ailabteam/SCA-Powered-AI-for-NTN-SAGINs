# SCA-Powered-AI-for-NTN-SAGINs (SPAIN)

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for the study and implementation of **Successive Convex Approximation (SCA)** algorithms and their variants. Our primary focus is on applying SCA to solve challenging **Non-Convex Optimization** problems arising in **Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN)** and **Satellite-Aided Global Information Networks (SAGINs)**.

The project emphasizes the crucial intersection between Optimization Theory and modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) frameworks, including Federated Learning (FL), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and Transfer Learning (TL).

## 🚀 Repository Structure

The core source code resides within the `src/` directory, organized into four main development phases:

| Directory | Description | Technical Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src/01_SCA_Fundamentals/` | Foundational implementations of basic SCA and its core techniques. | Theoretical background, clean code for core mechanics. |

## 🛠️ Environment Setup (Conda)

To ensure consistency, please use the provided `environment.yml` to set up your Conda environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sca-ntn-env
```

**Note:** All plotted results generated by the source code (`.py` files) will be saved as **PDF files** in the project root or a designated `output/` folder (to maintain clean code execution).

## 📚 Detailed Tutor Roadmap (12 Key Tasks)

This section details the specific tasks we aim to cover during the development of this repository, organized by complexity and application.

### Phase I: SCA Fundamentals (`src/01_SCA_Fundamentals`)

| Task ID | Title | Description and SCA Technique |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Task 1** | **Sum-Rate Maximization (Power Allocation)** | Implement basic SCA using the **First-Order Taylor Expansion** to transform the non-concave objective (SINR log function) into a sequence of convex sub-problems. |
| **Task 2** | **Fractional Programming (Dinkelbach's Method & SCA)** | Solve generalized fractional programs (e.g., maximizing the ratio of two functions) using the parametric Dinkelbach's method combined with SCA for the inner optimization loop. |
| **Task 3** | **Difference of Convex (DCP) Programming** | Implement the CCCP (Concave-Convex Procedure) algorithm to handle objectives/constraints that can be decomposed as the difference of two convex functions. |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Task 4** | **Distributed SCA (ADMM Integration)** | Develop an ADMM-based distributed SCA framework, crucial for massive NTN deployments, where the overall problem is decoupled into local optimization tasks solved by SCA. |
| **Task 5** | **Non-Convex Constraint Handling** | Implement techniques to handle complex non-convex constraints (e.g., quality-of-service (QoS) constraints or rate constraints) by replacing them with convex approximations (linear/affine approximations). |
| **Task 6** | **SCA Convergence Acceleration** | Explore methods to boost the convergence speed and robustness of SCA, focusing on advanced warm-start strategies and adaptive step-size adjustments (e.g., trust region methods). |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Task 7** | **SCA-Optimized Federated Learning (FL)** | Use SCA to optimize the **communication resources** (power, bandwidth, scheduling) of the satellite/ground clients in an FL setting, minimizing training latency or energy cost while maintaining learning performance. |
| **Task 8** | **GNN-Aided Resource Allocation** | Implement a hybrid system where a **GNN** models the dynamic NTN topology and predicts traffic/channel state, and **SCA** then uses these learned features to perform optimal dynamic resource allocation (e.g., routing). |
| **Task 9** | **Transfer Learning for SCA Warm-Start** | Demonstrate how optimal solutions derived from one SCA problem instance (Source Domain, e.g., low-density network) can be used via Transfer Learning to provide a highly effective warm-start for a new SCA problem (Target Domain, e.g., high-density network). |

### Phase IV: NTN/SAGINs Practical Applications (`src/04_Satellite_Use_Cases`)
